1.  Total_Dat.mat

   This includes the moth data sets for the 14 moths,  including the following three data structure.
 (a) Total_Datao:  which is the torque measurement data set whose dimension is N times 500, where N is the number of wingstrokes.
 (b) Total_Data: which is the normalized torque measurement data set.
 (c) Y_Data: which is the neural firing time (t_L and t_R) data sets whose dimension is N times 2, where the first column records t_L and the second column records t_R.

2. new_fin_data.m
  
   This is the Matlab working file for the moth data analysis

3. new_finsim1.m

   This is the Matlab working file for the simulation analysis

4. proj.m
 
   This is the Matlab function, which provide the symmetric matrix which minimize the matrix l1 norm w.r.t. input matrix.

5. proj1.m
  
   This is the Matlab function, which solves the following problem: for the vector v,
    min ||w-v||_2     subject to ||w||_1 <= b
   

6. estimator_i2_lassoo.m

   This is the Matlab function, which provides the proposed estimator \hat{\Theta}.  This uses the function composite2_new.m to solve the nodewise regression.

7. composite2_new.m

   This is the Matlab function, which includes the composite gradient descent algorithm.
